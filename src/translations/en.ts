    "Abstract.p1": `${KeywordAbstract} We present a comprehensive and formal definition of ${KeywordJam}, a protocol combining elements of both <i>Polkadot</i> and <i>Ethereum</i>. In a single coherent model, ${KeywordJam} provides a global singleton permissionless object environment&#8212;much like the smart-contract environment pioneered by Ethereum&#8212;paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot.`,
    "Abstract.p2": `${KeywordJam} introduces a decentralized hybrid system offering smart-contract functionality structured around a secure and scalable in-core/on-chain dualism. While the smart-contract functionality implies some similarities with Ethereum&#x2019;s paradigm, the overall model of the service offered is driven largely by underlying architecture of Polkadot.`,
    "Abstract.p3": `${KeywordJam} is permissionless in nature, allowing anyone to deploy code as a service on it for a fee commensurate with the resources this code utilizes and to induce execution of this code through the procurement and allocation of <i>core-time</i>, a metric of resilient and ubiquitous computation, somewhat similar to the purchasing of gas in Ethereum. We already envision a Polkadot-compatible <i>CoreChains</i> service.`,
