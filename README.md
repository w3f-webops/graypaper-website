## List of Clients

If you want to list your client or update your listing, please request
the change by opening a new issue with the [`Client listing request`](https://github.com/w3f-webops/graypaper-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=client-listing-request.md&title=Client+Listing%3A+XYZ) template.

Or even better, directly opening a pull request making the changes yourself. The clients are listed in the [`./src/data/clients.ts`](https://github.com/w3f-webops/graypaper-website/blob/main/src/data/clients.ts) file.

You can also fetch JSON list of clients file directly from the graypaper.com website for example show this list on your website as well.
